[] - Move the type-inference code back into its own repository (making sure to follow the Heron model, with the TS and the JS in the same place?)
[] - Add linter support 
[] - Turn on some errors
[] - Get deepscan working 
[] - Put the project into Travis CI
[] - Get a version of the project working in the browser
